every thing about blocktracking is in this folder, they are:
	func.lua	the main function of blocktracking
	calcPos.lua contains the functions of calculating the location of apriltags, boxes, structures
	tracking.lua if for tracking tags, boxes, structure in a serious of frames

	in folder math and solveSqu are tool functions, like Vector3, Matrix  etc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

the basic logic in func is:
	it holds a mind of all the tags and boxes

	for each frame, it takes all the 2D information of tags seen in current frame
	1. locating: calculate 3D position and rotation for each tag
	2. tracking: match each seen tag with the tags in mind(hungarian algorithm is used here), upgrade the tags in mind
	3. locating boxes: use this upgraded tags in mind to calculate the boxes position
	4. tracking boxes: match and upgrade boxes in mind
	5. structures: cluster boxes into structures
